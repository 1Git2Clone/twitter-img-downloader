# Twitter PNG Downloader

A very simple browser extension that adds a context menu option to save Twitter
images as a PNG directly.

It works by modifying the twitter image link to change the format of the image
(usually `jpg`) to `png` like so:

```txt
From:
- https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GfYlXIkbMAAG5XL?format=jpg&name=medium

To:
- https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GfYlXIkbMAAG5XL?format=png&name=large
```
